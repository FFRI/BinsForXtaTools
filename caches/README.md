This directory contains XTA cache files that are generated by running the following x86 applicatoins

- Branch.exe
- InjectCodeTemplate.exe
- InvisibleJmp.exe
- test_x86.exe

Branch.exe directory contains three different XTA cache files. These cache files can be obtained by the following commands.

```
> Branch.exe     -> We can get BRANCH.EXE.*.*.mp.1.jc
> Branch.exe 0 0 -> We can get BRANCH.EXE.*.*.mp.2.jc
> Branch.exe 0   -> We can get BRANCH.EXE.*.*.mp.3.jc
```

For reproducing result, you need to get XTA cache files from %SystemRoot%\XtaCache by running these applications on your environment.
